## Guide

__BIOS Settings (Version 1.08)__

- Set Supervisor Password
- Disable Password on Boot
- Disable Secure Boot
- Set touchpad: Advance

__Clover config__

Use rehabman's config: `config_HD615_620_630_640_650.plist`   
I used SSDT files and patches from: https://github.com/dongcodebmt/VX5-591G-OpenCore   
Boot args: `alcid=29 keepsyms=1 debug=0x100`   
I use `alcid=29` it seems fine, however I have not tried it with the headphone jack yet. If that doesn't work, try `alcid=30`   
For power management, create your own CPUFriend
